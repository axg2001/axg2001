    <p>
        Hello, welcome to Lemon's Math! My name is Axel and I host and develop this page from my laptop using HTML, CSS, and Githubs pages. I'm an Electrical Engineering major at the University of Texas at Dallas and graduated from SEM High School at TMC. I'm making this "website" for the purpose of applying the concepts I learn from the courses I watch on youtube over HTML and CSS. Although I plan to minor in CS, I'm not too great when it comes to web design/development so bear with me. I LOVE math so I figured this would be a fun topic to make a website on, however, there is always a possbility I may makae a mistake so feel free to reach out to me.

    <p>Hello, this Sa√∫l the co-host of this page that helps Axel :D</p>
    <p> I am currently a student attending college and I decided to assit Axel in creating this website. I have a strong belief in having education being accessed at no cost to 
        anyone, and so I decided to help Axel and share my knowledge to you all. Math is the subject I'm the best at and so, I'll be taking the time to share what I know to you guys, hopefully 
        from a different perspective to help you better understad the concept. As it stands I am currently working on <a href = "courses/linearalgebra.html"> linear algebra</a>, so take a peek if you're interested. 
        Enjoy this website we created and learn a thing or two, I for sure have learned a lot doing this ^-^</p>
