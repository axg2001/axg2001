        Hello, welcome to Lemon's Math! My name is Axel and I host and develop this page from my laptop using HTML, CSS, and Githubs pages. I'm an Electrical Engineering major at the University of Texas at Dallas and graduated from SEM High School at TMC. I'm making this "website" for the purpose of applying the concepts I learn from the courses I watch on youtube over HTML and CSS. Although I plan to minor in CS, I'm not too great when it comes to web design/development so bear with me. I LOVE math so I figured this would be a fun topic to make a website on, however, there is always a possbility I may makae a mistake so feel free to reach out to me.
