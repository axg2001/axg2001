    <p>
        Hello, welcome to Lemon's Math! My name is Axel and I host and develop this page from my laptop using HTML, CSS, and Githubs pages. I'm an Electrical Engineering major at the University of Texas at Dallas and graduated from SEM High School at TMC. I'm making this "website" for the purpose of applying the concepts I learn from the courses I watch on youtube over HTML and CSS. Although I plan to minor in CS, I'm not too great when it comes to web design/development so bear with me. I LOVE math so I figured this would be a fun topic to make a website on, however, there is always a possbility I may makae a mistake so feel free to reach out to me.

    <p>Hai! This is Saúl the co-host of this page that helps Axel :D</p>
    <p> I am currently a student attending college and I decided to assit Axel in creating this website. I have a strong belief in having education being accessed at no cost to 
        anyone, and so I decided to help Axel and share my knowledge to you all. Math is the subject I have the most and so, I'll be taking the time to share what I know to you guys, hopefully 
        from a different perspective to help you better understad the concept. As it stands I finished working on <a href = "courses/linearalgebra.html"> linear algebra</a>, so take a peek if you're interested. 
        Other than that, enjoy this website we created and learn a thing or two, I for sure have learned a lot doing this ^-^</p>

    <p> Hello, this is Maria, the amazing <a href = "https://lemonsmath.github.io/lemonsmath/courses/integralcalc.html">integral calc</a> tutor that hasn’t quite finished their job. I’m now a rising freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in computer science 
        (though, I was a junior in HS when we started lol). Some of my passions include decreasing the education gap in low-income communities, increasing representation/diversity in STEM, and computer science 
        (hence the major). I hope to create an impact with computer science, which is why when Axel rushed into my room about making this website, I (hesitantly) agreed.</p>
