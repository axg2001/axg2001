    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">Another linear proof that looks into the real spectrum theorem. This is not the general proof since it is beyond linear algebra, but I will show that a symmetric 2-by-2 matrix is always diagonalizable.</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/ZZUQva8UXKA">Linear Proof | Orthogonal Matrices</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">This video will show why an orthogonal matrix contains a base of orthonormal column vectors.</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/yBja2l9ScbE">Example | Eigenvalues and Eigenspace of Symmetrical Matrices</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">We are back with actual examples now :D As usual, the first example will be simple and will look at the eigenvalues and eigenspace of symmetrical matrices to show that they all give real eigenvalues.</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/uE4w3fmYS04">Example | Orthogonal Matrices</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">This video will focus on checking if a matrix is an orthogonal matrix.</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/qN9SM8YcJOg">Example | Orthogonal Diagonalization</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">For our last example in this lecture, we will be diagonalizing symmetrical matrices with an orthogonal matrix.</p>
    
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/MNjOkXxCgwU">Lecture 15 | Complex and Defective Eigenvalues</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">OUR LAST LECTURE FOR LINEAR ALGEBRA!!!!!!! This lecture talk about different types of eigenvalues and as well as the Jordan-Canonical Form.</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/ltz7rvYjOow">Example | Complex Eigenvalues</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">This video will calculate eigenvectors with complex eigenvalues just to show that it is no different than if they were real. It can also take less time :D</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/MZUEGpBAjr4">Example | Prediciting the Jordan-Canonical Form</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">Did you know that you can "predict" how the Jordan normal form will look simply by using the eigenvalues you found on a given matrix ;-;</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:30px;"><a href = "https://youtu.be/txMIDiOl_N4">Example | Finding Our Invertible Matrix for the Jordan-Canonical Form</a></h2>
    <p style = "color:white; font-size:24px;">OUR LAST EXAMPLES FOR LINEAR ALGEBRA!!! This last example video will show how to find our invertible matrix so we can have an almost diagonal matrix, known as the Jordan-Canonical Form. A farewell to you guys for now ;)</p>
